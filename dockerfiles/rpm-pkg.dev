# Using almalinux:8 gets us a pretty early version of glibc (2.17)
# Much easier to build on fedora:42, which has an up-to-date golang too,
# but then we get a glibc at version 2.37. There are other solutions using
# mock, but this is the simplest for now.

# on almalinux, these magical incantations are needed to get
# pcsc-lite-devel. They are not needed on fedora:36+
