    <summary>command-line interface to FOKS, the Federated Open Key Service</summary>
    <description>
FOKS is a federated protocol that allows for online public key advertisement,
sharing, and rotation. It works for a user and their many devices, for many users who want
to form a group, for groups of groups etc. The core primitive is that several
private key holders can conveniently share a private key; and that private key
can simply correspond to another public/private key pair, which can be members
of a group one level up. This pattern can continue recursively forming a tree.

Crucially, if any private key is removed from a key share, all shares rooted at
that key must rotate. FOKS implements that rotation.

Like email or the Web, the world consists of multiple FOKS servers, administrated
independently and speaking the same protocol. Groups can span multiple federated
services.

Many applications can be built on top of this primitive but best suited are those
that share end-to-end encrypted, persistent information across groups of users with multiple
devices. For instance, files and git hosting.
